Welcome to Grace Hopper Celebration Open Source Day workshop
 **An Illustrated Guide to MLOps using Kubeflow** by
 [Anna Jung](https://github.com/annajung) and [Diana Atanasova](https://github.com/difince)

`Workshop Description`  
 As machine learning becomes more common, machine learning operations (MLOps) become
 an essential practice for training, deploying, managing, and scaling production models.
 So, what is MLOps and how do you get started? In this workshop, Anna and Diana will
 walk you through the importance of MLOps and how you build an automated machine learning
 pipeline using an open source project [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow).

*This scenario is **not** a standalone scenario. Workshop attendance is required for complete step-by-step instructions.*
